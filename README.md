### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Margaux and I am a Cloud Solution Architect in Data and AI at Microsoft, specializing in the design and management of data and AI solutions on the cloud and driving business decisions. With a background in business engineering and a Master's degree in data analytics from UGent, I have a foundation in both business and data analytics. Prior to my current role, I worked as a data engineer, gaining experience in data pipelines and machine learning model development.
